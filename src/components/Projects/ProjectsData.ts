        I made this project for the university where I studied and graduated as a web developer. They needed a more convenient and reliable way to <span class='highlighted'>track attendees</span> to their event, and attendees a <span class='highlighted'>faster way to register and pay</span>, since they previously did it manually. <span class='highlighted'>I Implemented a payment gateway</span>, a table with FIFO sorting algorithm with all the registered users and a view with detailed statistics to improve the process efficiency.`,
